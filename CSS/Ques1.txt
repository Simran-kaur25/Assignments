What is the use of float property? Which property is the better alternative to it?

Float Property in CSS
The float property in CSS is used to position elements to the left or right within their container, allowing other elements such as text to wrap around them.
It was earlier used for creating web layouts before the introduction of modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
Values of float Property
Value                                Description
none                                 Default value (element does not float).
left                                 The element floats to the left of its container.
right                                The element floats to the right of its container.
inherit                              Inherits the float value from its parent element.


Problems with float-
Not Responsive: It doesn’t adapt well to different screen sizes.
Collapsing Parent Elements: If a parent container only contains floated elements, it collapses because it doesn’t recognize their height.
Difficult to Maintain: Managing layouts with floats requires additional CSS fixes like clearfix.

Better Alternatives to float
1. Flexbox (display: flex;)
Provides a more flexible and responsive way to arrange elements.
Can align elements horizontally and vertically with ease.
2. CSS Grid (display: grid;)
Allows designing complex layouts without extra divs.
Provides precise control over row and column placement.
