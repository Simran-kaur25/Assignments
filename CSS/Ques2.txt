2. Explain the difference between absolute and relative positions.
The difference between absolute and relative positioning in CSS is:

    Relative Positioning (position: relative;)
        The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
        Moving it using top, right, bottom, or left shifts it from where it would normally be.
        The space it originally occupied is still reserved.

    Absolute Positioning (position: absolute;)
        The element is removed from the normal document flow.
        It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position: relative, absolute, or fixed).
        If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned relative to the <html> (viewport).
        The space it originally occupied is not reserved.

Example:

.parent {
    position: relative;
    width: 300px;
    height: 300px;
    background: lightblue;
}

.child {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background: red;
}

Here, .child is positioned inside .parent because .parent has position: relative;.
