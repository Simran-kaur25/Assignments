4. How are inline and block elements different from each other?


1. Inline Elements
Do not start on a new line.
Take up only as much width as necessary.
Cannot have width and height explicitly set.
Allow other elements to appear next to them in the same line.

Examples:
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red word</span> inside a paragraph.</p>
<a href="#">Click Here</a>

In above example:
<span> is an inline element, so it does not break the paragraph structure.
<a> is also inline, so multiple links can be placed in a single line.
Common Inline Elements:
<span> – Used for styling a part of text.
<a> – Used for hyperlinks.
<b>, <i>, <u>, <strong>, <em> – Formatting elements.
<img> – Displays an image within a line.

2. Block Elements
Always start on a new line.
Take up the full width of their parent container.
Support width, height, margin, and padding.
Stack vertically by default.

Examples:
<div style="background-color: lightblue;">This is a block element</div>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>

In above example:
<div>, <p>, and <h1> are block elements, so each starts on a new line.
Common Block Elements:
<div> – Generic container.
<p> – Paragraph.
<h1> to <h6> – Headings.
<ul>, <ol>, <li> – Lists.
<form>, <table>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <header> – Structural elements.
