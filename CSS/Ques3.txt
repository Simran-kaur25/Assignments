3. What are the different types of CSS Selectors?

CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements on your pages, allowing you to apply styles based on their ID, class, type attributes, and more. 

There are mainly 5 types of selectors.

Basic CSS Selectors: These are used to target elements by tag, .class, or #id for fundamental styling needs.
Combinators: Ideal for styling elements based on their DOM relationships (e.g., parent-child or sibling relationships).
Group Selectors: Use to apply the same styles to multiple, unrelated elements simultaneously.
Attribute Selectors: Perfect for styling elements based on specific attributes or values, such as form inputs or links with certain prefixes or states.
Pseudo-Classes: Best for styling elements dynamically or interactively, like :hover for user interaction or :nth-child() for structural styling.

Types of CSS Selectors
Basic Selectors -
Basic selectors in CSS are simple tools used to target specific HTML elements for styling.
1. Universal Selector (*): Selects all elements on the page and applies the same style universally. 
For example, setting the font color for every element.
* {
    color: red;
  }


2. Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type, such as paragraphs or headers. 
For example, setting a common font size for all paragraphs
p {
    font-size: 16px;
}

3. Class Selector (.): Applies styles to elements with a specific class attribute. 
For example, making all buttons have a blue background.
.button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}

4. ID Selector (#): Styles a single element identified by its unique id. 
For example, changing the background color of a header
       #header {
           background-color: gray;
       }

Combinator Selectors
Combinators in CSS are used to define relationships between selectors, allowing you to style elements based on their hierarchy or positioning in the document. Common combinators include descendant ( ), child (>), adjacent sibling (+), and general sibling (~).
1. Descendant Selectors
2. Child Selector (>)
3. Adjacent Sibling Selector (+):
4. General Sibling Selector (~): 

Attribute Selectors
Attribute selectors in CSS target elements based on the presence or value of their attributes. Examples include [attr] (selects elements with the attribute), [attr=”value”] (matches specific values), and [attr^=”val”] (matches values starting with “val”).
1. Presence Selector: 
2. Attribute Value Selector: It targets elements with a particular attribute value. For example, styling text inputs.
3. Substring Matching(^=): It matches elements where the attribute contains a substring. For example, styling links with https in their href.
4. Wildcard Selector (*=): Matches elements where the attribute value contains a specific string. For example, underlining links with example in the URL.
