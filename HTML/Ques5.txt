Meta tags are used in HTML to provide metadata about a webpage. This metadata helps browsers, search engines, and social media platforms understand 
the content and behavior of the page.They are mainly used for
1. SEO (Search Engine Optimization): 
The most important aspect of meta tags is their role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) by providing crucial details like page titles and descriptions 
that appear in search engine results pages (SERPs). 
Improve search engine rankings with keywords and descriptions.
2. Responsive Design:
Control viewport settings for mobile-friendly layouts.  
3.Social Media:
Enhance content previews when shared on platforms like Facebook or Twitter. 
4. HTML placement:
Meta tags are embedded within the <head> section of an HTML document, meaning they are not visible on the webpage itself but are read by search engines.  

Example:
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Learn web development with easy tutorials.">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
