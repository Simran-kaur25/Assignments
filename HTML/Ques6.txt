Q6 What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

ID in HTML-
An ID is a unique identifier that is used to target a single, specific element in the HTML document.
The id attribute is assigned to an element to give it a unique identifier.
Example:
<div id="header">This is the header section</div>
Each ID must be unique within a page. No two elements on the same page can have the same id. This means that the ID can be used to uniquely reference or target that element.

Class in HTML
A class is used to group multiple elements together. It is not unique, so the same class can be applied to multiple elements on the page.
The class attribute is assigned to an element to specify a common class that may be shared by multiple elements.
Example:
<div class="content">This is a content section.</div>
<div class="content">This is another content section.</div>
The same class name can be used on multiple elements within the same page. Unlike IDs, classes are not unique.

Differences Between IDs and Classes

                	Unique — only one element can have a specific ID in a page.                       Not unique — multiple elements can share the same class.

CSS Selector         	#example (uses # symbol)                                                                     .example (uses . symbol)
Usage            	For uniquely identifying and styling a single element.                                 For styling or selecting multiple elements at once.

                                                                                                                       multiple elements.
