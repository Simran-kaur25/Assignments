Q1  What is HTML, and how is an HTML document structured?

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the structure of a web page by using tags and attributes. The tags are used to specify different parts of the web page, such as headings,
paragraphs, links, images, and other content.

HTML5 -
HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML standard, and it brought a lot of new features and improvements over previous versions. Its goal was to improve support for multimedia (audio, video) and modern web applications.
1. New Structural Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic elements to help define the structure of a page more clearly
<header> , <footer> , <nav> , <main> , <aside>
2. Multimedia Elements: HTML5 introduced native support for embedding multimedia without needing third-party plugins like Flash.
<audio> , <video>
3. Geolocation: HTML5 provides an API for getting the user's geographic location through the browser.

Structure of an HTML Document
An HTML document has a specific structure made up of elements, most of which are nested inside each other.

	<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration defines the document type and version of HTML being used  It is placed at the very top of the document.

	<html>: This is the root element that contains all of the HTML content.

	<head>: This section contains meta-information about the document, such as the title of the page, character encoding, and links to stylesheets or scripts.
Ex-
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>My Web Page</title>
</head>

<body>: This section contains the actual content that is visible on the web page, such as text, images, and other media.

Ex-

	<body>
    	<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    	<p>This is a paragraph of text on the page.</p>
	</body>

Example of an HTML Document:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<title>Simple HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Welcome to My Simple HTML Page</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph on the page.</p>
</body>
</html>
