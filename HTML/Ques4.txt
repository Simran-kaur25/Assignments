Q4.  What is semantic HTML? List some semantic and non-semantic elements.


Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML tags that have meaning and describe the content they contain, making the structure of the document more understandable
both for humans and for machines. These tags convey information about the type
of content they wrap, improving accessibility and SEO.
Non-semantic HTML tags don't provide any information about the content inside them, and are often just used for styling or layout purposes.

SEMANTIC ELEMENTS:-
<header>: Defines the header section of a page or a section.
<footer>: Represents the footer section of a page or a section.
<article>: Defines independent, self-contained content that can be reused (like a blog post or news article).
<section>: Represents a section of a document, such as a group of related content.
<nav>: Used for defining navigation links.
<aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it (e.g., sidebars or pull quotes).
<main>: Represents the main content of a document (unique to the page and not duplicated across pages).
<mark>: Represents highlighted text.

NON SEMANTIC ELEMENTS
<div>: A generic container that has no semantic meaning.
<span>: A generic inline container used for styling or grouping inline elements.
<b>: Represents bold text, but without any semantic meaning.
<i>: Represents italicized text, but like <b>, it is a non-semantic element used for styling purposes.
<u>: Represents underlined text, typically used for styling purposes only.
